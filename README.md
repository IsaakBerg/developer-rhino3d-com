# developer-rhino3d-com

This repo contains the contents of http://developer.rhino3d.com

The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which uses a static site generator called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Getting Started

These instructions cover running this project locally on both macOS and Windows so that you can preview changes before pushing them to GitHub Pages.

First, navigate somewhere safe and clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/mcneel/developer-rhino3d-com.git
```

If you are not comfortable using git on the command-line, then try [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) and [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/). There's also the [git cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

**IMPORTANT:** The site is branch-aware and automatically deployed by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mcneel/developer-rhino3d-com). **DO NOT PUSH TO THE `gh-pages` BRANCH!**

The `master` branch represents the current (_stable_) version of the site.  Changes to the `master` branch will be built by Travis and deployed to http://developer.rhino3d.com.  Other branches can be defined in `_config.yml` (under `version_branches`) and will be built and deployed into a subpath with the same name.  For example, if you push to the `wip` branch (representing RhinoWIP) then this site will be deployed to http://developer.rhino3d.com/wip.


### macOS

macOS ships with Ruby and RubyGems, however it's [not wise](https://github.com/mcneel/developer-rhino3d-com/pull/2#issuecomment-112601698) to mess around with this installation. Instead, install your own Ruby using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

**Note**: Since OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) we've seen failures during the `gem install` step (`ERROR: While executing gem ... (Errno::EINVAL)`). We are investigating...

#### Install Homebrew and Ruby

As per the Homebrew website, install via the following one-liner (which will prompt you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools, if you don't already have them).

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then we can brew Ruby.

```
brew install ruby
```

Now close and reopen the Terminal window to make sure the system knows about the new version of Ruby.

#### Install Jekyll

The [GitHub Pages Ruby Gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) provides the same version of Jekyll as exists on the GitHub Pages servers. This ensures we aren't accidentally using features that have either been deprecated or simply don't exist yet!

```
gem install github-pages
```

You can now serve your local copy of this site by running the following commands, remembering to replace `CLONE_DIRECTORY` with the location to which you checked out this repository.

```
cd CLONE_DIRECTORY
./script/server
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4000 in your browser to view the site.

(NOTE: The */api* folder generation is excluded locally to speed things up.)


### Windows

While **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/)** is not officially supported in Windows, it does work.  These instructions are based on the official _unofficial_ guide to [installing Jekyll on Windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/).

#### Install Ruby and Ruby DevKit

Go to http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ and download the installer for Ruby 2.1.X that matches your system architecture (x86/x64).

At the "Installation Destination and Optional Tasks" dialog, make sure to check the **"Add Ruby executable to your PATH"** box.

Then, from the same page download the Development Kit that corresponds to your Ruby installation. Jekyll won't be fully functional without this.

Run the self extracting archive, entering the path `C:\RubyDevKit` when prompted.

To initialize and install the DevKit, open up a command prompt and roll up your sleeves...

```
cd C:\RubyDevKit
ruby dk.rb init
ruby dk.rb install
```

#### Install Jekyll and serve

As with macOS, install the GitHub Pages Ruby Gem, navigate to the clone directory and run jekyll.

```
gem install github-pages
cd CLONE_DIRECTORY
jekyll serve
```
